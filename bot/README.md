# প্রবাহ — Professional Ultra Quiz Bot

The original `Pro_mongo_finalsexxes.py` (~25,600 lines) has been split into
an ordered set of section files under `bot/sections/`. **Behaviour is
identical** — sections are executed in the original order inside a single
shared globals namespace, so the dozens of late "FINAL OVERRIDE / PATCH"
sections still monkey-patch the earlier definitions exactly as before.

## Layout

```
bot/
├── config.py            # BOT_TOKEN, OWNER_ID — edit here (or use env vars)
├── __main__.py          # Entry point — `python -m bot`
├── __init__.py
├── requirements.txt
└── sections/
    ├── 00_header_imports.py
    ├── 01_config.py
    ├── 02_render_health_server.py
    ├── …                                (48 ordered files total)
    └── 47_elevenlabs_voice_to_text_06_04.py
```

Each section file maps to a clearly named chunk of the original script —
core router, OCR patches, group/topic patches, MongoDB backup, ElevenLabs
voice-to-text, etc. The filename prefix (`00_`, `01_`, …) **is** the load
order; do not rename without renumbering.

## Configuration

`bot/config.py` reads the following env vars (with the original hard-coded
values as fallbacks):

| Env var      | Purpose                              |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| `BOT_TOKEN`  | Telegram bot token from @BotFather   |
| `OWNER_ID`   | Numeric owner id (or comma-separated)|

All other runtime settings (Gemini / Perplexity / Mistral / ElevenLabs
keys, MongoDB URI, etc.) are still read from environment variables exactly
as in the original script — see the relevant section file or use the
matching in-bot `/setkey`, `/elevenlabs`, `/mistral`, … commands.

## Install & run

```bash
pip install -r bot/requirements.txt
# from the project root:
python -m bot
```

## Deploy to Render (Free Web Service)

The repo root has `main.py`, `requirements.txt`, `Procfile`, `runtime.txt`
and `render.yaml` ready to go.

1. Push to GitHub (already done via Lovable's GitHub integration).
2. On Render → **New + → Blueprint** → pick this repo → **Apply**.
   (Or **New + → Web Service**, runtime `Python`, build
   `pip install -r requirements.txt`, start `python main.py`.)
3. In the service's **Environment** tab set:
   - `BOT_TOKEN` — your Telegram bot token
   - `OWNER_ID`  — your numeric Telegram id
   - `MONGO_URI` — `mongodb+srv://…` (only if you want PATCH-R backup)
   - any AI keys you use: `GEMINI_API_KEY`, `MISTRAL_API_KEY`,
     `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY`
4. Render assigns a public URL like `https://probaho-bot.onrender.com`.
   - **`/`** — clickable browser health page (uptime, MongoDB, version)
   - **`/healthz`** · **`/ping`** · **`/readyz`** — tiny `OK` for monitors
   - **`/status.json`** — JSON for programmatic checks

### Free-tier bandwidth (≈ 5 GB friendly)

- HTML health page is ~3 KB, JSON ~70 B, probe ~2 B. Pinging
  `/healthz` every 5 min for a whole month uses ≈ 18 KB — negligible.
- Long-polling traffic with Telegram is the dominant cost; this is
  unchanged from your original single-file bot.

### Keeping the service awake

Render Free spins the service down after 15 min of HTTP inactivity.
Point a free uptime monitor (UptimeRobot, BetterStack, cron-job.org) at
`https://<your-service>.onrender.com/healthz` every 5 min to keep the
bot polling Telegram around the clock.

### MongoDB

PATCH-R is already wired in (`bot/sections/46_probaho_patch_r_*`). Set
`MONGO_URI` (and optional `MONGO_DB_NAME`, default `probaho_bot`) in
Render's environment and the bot will resume weekly Sunday 03:00 UTC
backup syncs exactly like before. Without `MONGO_URI` Mongo backup is
inert — every other feature still works.

## Why this layout instead of `handlers/`, `services/`, `db/`?

The original script defines the same function name up to 4–5 times across
chronological "PATCH" blocks; only the last redefinition wins at runtime,
and many patches wrap earlier definitions (e.g. `_prev_main_elevenlabs = main; def main(): …; _prev_main_elevenlabs()`).
Re-architecting that into conventional `handlers/services/db` modules
without a full test harness would silently break behaviour. The
section-based layout gives you a professional, browsable file structure
*and* a 100% behaviour-preserving execution model. Once you have a test
rig in place we can iteratively collapse the patches into clean modules.

## How to edit

- Tweak a feature: edit the **last** section file that touches it (later
  sections override earlier ones — that's how the original works too).
- Add a brand-new feature: create `bot/sections/48_<your_slug>.py`. It is
  exec'd after every existing patch, so it can safely reference (and
  override) anything defined earlier.
- Never `import` a section file directly — they share globals via the
  runner, not via Python's normal import system.

## Telegram Rich Text (native tables / LaTeX / task lists)

Section `77_telethon_rich_text_transport_07_31.py` adds real Telegram Rich
Messages through an MTProto side-client (Telethon) that logs in with the same
bot token.

Environment variables (optional):

| Variable | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `TELEGRAM_API_ID` | api_id from https://my.telegram.org |
| `TELEGRAM_API_HASH` | api_hash from https://my.telegram.org |
| `RICH_TEXT` | set to `off` to hard-disable rich sending |

Behaviour:

* Every outbound text (user, admin, owner, AI answers, OCR answers) is upgraded
  automatically — the transport hooks `Bot.send_message` / `Bot.edit_message_text`.
* Short status/progress pings stay on the classic path so they can always be
  edited and deleted as before.
* Any missing credential or MTProto error falls back silently to the previous
  HTML behaviour (with a 5-minute cooldown so users never see extra latency).

Owner commands: `/rich on|off|status` and `/richdemo`.

## Owner quiz generation (section 78)

- `.aiq [standard] [count] [topic]` — reply to any text/topic message (or pass the
  topic inline) to generate unlimited MCQs into the buffer, e.g.
  `.aiq buet 50`, `.aiq dmc 30`, `.aiq board 100`.
- `.gen med|eng|ver|std` now also accepts an exam standard token:
  `buet cuet kuet ruet du ju cu ru sust dmc medical dental gst board hsc ssc bcs`.
- Math MCQs are posted in two messages: a native rich-text card with the full
  question + options (LaTeX preserved), followed by a quiz poll asking
  "উপরের প্রশ্নের সঠিক উত্তর কোনটি?" with label-only options.
- `/qver bn|en` — poll language/labels (ক খ গ ঘ vs A B C D).
- `/mathpost on|off` — toggle the math two-message format.
- `/shuffle on|off` — option order. **Default OFF** → options stay in the
  original ক খ গ ঘ order (no more এলোমেলো order).
- `/postdelay <seconds>` — pause between two quiz posts. **Default 3 s**, so
  Telegram never rate-limits and the bot never freezes mid-post.
- All math text (questions, options, poll explanations, AI/OCR answers) now
  passes through the section-79 Unicode math engine, which repairs
  backslash-stripped LaTeX (`vec{A}`, `hat{i}`, `frac{5}{sqrt{2}}`,
  `90^circ`, `Rightarrow`) into clean professional math: `A⃗`, `î`, `5/√2`,
  `90°`, `⇒`.

## Section 81 — language lock, stop control, topic slideshow (2026-08-02)

- **Language lock:** `.aiq`/`.gen` accept a language token — `en|english|ইংরেজি`
  (English-only), `bn|bangla|বাংলা` (Bangla-only), `std|standard|mixed`
  (professional mix). No token → detected from the source script. Enforced in
  the AI prompt *and* by dropping off-language generated items.
  Example: `.aiq buet en 50`, `.gen med bn 30`, `.aiq board standard 40`.
- **Stop control:** `/stopquiz` (`.stopquiz`) halts an ongoing posting or
  generation run after the current quiz; `/resumequiz` clears the flag.
- **Topic slideshow:** `.topicimg top|bottom <urls…>` or reply to a photo with
  `.topicimg top` to attach a reviewable image slideshow above/below the AI
  rich topic. `.topicimg clear` removes it. Slides are sent with the topic on
  Confirm / Send & Pin.
- **Command visibility:** all new commands are added to the owner "/" menu, and
  `/allcmds` sends the complete registered command list to the owner inbox.

## Section 82 — post-link topic anchors (2026-08-02)

- **`.linktopic <t.me post link> [| name]`** (aliases `.lt`, `.topiclink`):
  turn any **existing** channel/group post into the active topic anchor.
  From then on every posted quiz replies to that post — same-chat as a normal
  reply, cross-chat via Bot API `ReplyParameters` (a tappable header linking
  back to the original post; nothing is copied or forwarded).
  Stays active until a new topic is set (`.aitopic`, `.settopic`) or removed.
- Supported links: `t.me/c/<id>/<post>`, `t.me/c/<id>/<thread>/<post>`,
  `t.me/<username>/<post>`, `t.me/<username>/<thread>/<post>` — with or without
  `https://`, `telegram.me`, and `?comment=`/`#` suffixes are ignored.
- You can also **reply to a forwarded post** with `.linktopic` (no link needed).
- The bot copies the target post to your inbox as a verification preview; if it
  cannot, the anchor is still saved and you get a warning to make the bot admin.
- **`.topicinfo`** shows the active anchor (chat, post id, link).
  **`.topicoff`** removes it. Linked posts are also stored in `.mytopics`.

## Section 83 — safe math cards + rich text for users (2026-08-02)

- Math rich cards never show a half formula: a LaTeX run is sent as a native
  `mathematical_expression` block only when it is complete and balanced;
  anything else is rendered as clean Unicode math text (nothing is trimmed).
- Truncated poll stems are recovered from the raw item registry, so the card
  always carries the full question plus every option.
- Math items now follow the selected language (`en` / `bn` / standard): the
  stem prose is written in that language and formulas stay inside `$...$`.
- Every user-facing AI/OCR answer is delivered as a native rich message
  (real math, tables, headings) with the classic HTML path as a silent
  fallback, so users never see a formatting error.
